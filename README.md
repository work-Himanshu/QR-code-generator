# QR-code-generator
A basic project on nodejs.
This is a project for implementing basic Nodejs programming, i have used inquirer, fs, qr-image in this module.
Build a simple website using bootstrap for allowing QR code to be visible to the user.
I created .gitignore to avoid the undesired files like node module and inquirer and qr-image package from getting pushed to the repository.
